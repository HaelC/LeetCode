## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)  
<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b>
</p><pre>s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
</pre>

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (freq[s[i] - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

*Analysis*:
We use a vector with size 26. It is a fixed number and it is regared as constant space.


**Idea**  
We just use a hashmap to store the frequencies of each character in the string. Since the string contains only lowercase letters, we can simply use `vector`/`int[]` rather than `unordered_map<char, int>/HashMap<Character, Integer>` to improve performance. We just go through the string twice: the first time to store the frequencies and the second time to find the character whose frequency is 1.
