# 344. Reverse String
## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters <code>char[]</code>.</p>

<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by <strong>modifying the input array&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a></strong> with O(1) extra memory.</p>

<p>You may assume all the characters consist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters" target="_blank">printable ascii characters</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">["h","e","l","l","o"]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">["o","l","l","e","h"]</span>
</pre>

<div>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-2-1">["H","a","n","n","a","h"]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-2">["h","a","n","n","a","H"]</span>

## Solutions
### Solution 1
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[n - i - 1];
            s[n - i - 1] = temp;
        }
    }
};
```

- Space complexity: ![](resources/constant.png)


**Idea**  
Just iterate through the string, swap the characters. Note that the terminate condition in for loop is `n / 2` rather than `n` (or the string will restore).  
If the computation of `n - i - 1` is a bit weird, we can use two pointers as well:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;            
        }
    }
};
```

### Solution 2
```c++
class Solution {
private:
    void reverseHelper(vector<char>& s, int i, int j) {
        if (i >= j)
            return;
        char temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = temp;
        reverseHelper(s, i+1, j-1);
    }
    
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        reverseHelper(s, 0, s.size() - 1);
    }
};
```

*Analysis*:  
The space complexity is linear as a result of recursion.

**Idea**  
We can use recursion to reverse the string. The base case is when the length of the string that we need to reverse is less than or equal to 1, which means we don't need to do anything.  
The recursion step is only swap the first character and the last character. Then we can focus on a shorter string and simplify the problem.
