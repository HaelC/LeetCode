# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
## Problem
Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.  

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.  

**Note:**  
- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
  
**Example:**  

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
<b>Output:</b> [1,2]
<b>Explanation:</b> The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
</pre>


## Solution 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> result;
        int l = 0, r = numbers.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            // int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
            int diff = target - numbers[r];     // to deal with possible overflow
            if (numbers[l] == diff) {
                result.push_back(l+1);          // not zero-based
                result.push_back(r+1);
                break;
            }
            else if (numbers[l] < diff) {       // numbers[l] + numbers[r] < target 
                l++;
            }
            else {                              // numbers[l] + numbers[r] > target
                r--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Idea**  
We can refer to the solutions in [Two Sum](https://github.com/HaelChan/LeetCode/blob/master/Explanations/1.%20Two%20Sum.md). But the sorted property is ignored. We can use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, to go through the array. The left pointer points to the *small value*, and the right points to the *big* one. If the sum of two pointers' element is the target, job is done. If the sum is less than target, it means that the *small value* is too small, we need to increase the *small value* by right-shifting the left pointer; if the sum is larger than target, we just need to left-shift the right pointer to decrease the *big value*.  
BTW, if the original [Two Sum](https://github.com/HaelChan/LeetCode/blob/master/Explanations/1.%20Two%20Sum.md) problem requires the value rather than the index as output, we can have another loglinear solution: sort the array first (loglinear) and then use the solution (linear) in this explanation.
