## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-sequence/)  
<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Given an array <code>A</code> of integers, return the <strong>length</strong> of the longest arithmetic subsequence in <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Recall that a <em>subsequence</em> of <code>A</code> is a list <code>A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k]</code> with <code>0 &lt;= i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; ... &lt; i_k &lt;= A.length - 1</code>, and that a sequence <code>B</code>&nbsp;is <em>arithmetic</em> if <code>B[i+1] - B[i]</code> are all the same value (for <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; B.length - 1</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[3,6,9,12]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">4</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-2-1">[9,4,7,2,10]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-2">3</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].

## Solution: Dynamic Programming
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        int result = 0;
        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = A[i]-A[j];
                dp[i][diff] = dp[j].count(diff) > 0 ? dp[j][diff] + 1 : 2;
                result = max(result, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Idea**  
My explanation is posted on [LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-sequence/discuss/474884/c-dp-with-explanation) as well.  
This problem is similar to [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/) problem. The difference is that we need to consider the *arithmetic difference* in this problem. How to keep track of the length as well as the difference? We can use a hashmap, whose key is the difference and value is the length. Then we can solve the problem with dynamic programming:  
As noted in the problem description, `2 <= A.length`, so we don't need to consider the edge case when there is no element or only one element in `A`. The base case is `A.length == 2`, then `A` itself is the longest arithmetic subsequence because any two numbers meet the condition of *arithmetic*.  
The optimization step is that for two elements `A[i]` and `A[j]` where `j < i`, the difference between `A[i]` and `A[j]` (name it `diff`) is a critical condition. If the hashmap at position `j` has the key `diff`, it means that there is an arithmetic subsequence ending at index `j`, with arithmetic difference `diff` and length `dp[j][diff]`. And we just add the length by `1`. If hashmap does not have the key `diff`, then those two elements can form a 2-length arithmetic subsequence.
