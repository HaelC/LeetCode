# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)  
<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Given a string <code>S</code> of lowercase letters, a <em>duplicate removal</em> consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.</p>

<p>Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.&nbsp; It is guaranteed the answer is unique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">"abbaca"</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">"ca"</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.&nbsp; The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><code>1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 20000</code></li>
    <li><code>S</code> consists only of English lowercase letters.</li>
</ol></div></div>

## Solutions
### Solution 1: Stack
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string S) {
        stack<char> st;
        for (char c : S) {
            if (st.empty() || c != st.top()) {
                st.push(c);
            }
            else {
                st.pop();
            }
        }
        string result = "";
        while (!st.empty()) {
            result += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Idea**  
We can use a stack to keep track of the characters when we go through the string. The top element of stack (if exists) is the last distinct charcter that we have seen. If the current character is the same as last character, then we just pop that element. If not, we push the character to the stack.  
BTW, when converting stack to string, it would be faster to append the character to the end of string with a `reverse`, than `result = st.top() + result`.

### Solution 2: Two Pointers
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string S) {
        if (S.length() < 2) {
            return S;
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = 1;
        while (right < S.length()) {
            if (left >= 0 && S[left] == S[right]) {
                left--;
            }
            else {
                S[++left] = S[right];
            }
            right++;
        }
        return S.substr(0, left + 1);
    }
};
```

**Idea**  
We can use the two pointers to solve this problem. The `left` pointer maintains the result and `right` is used to iterate the string.
