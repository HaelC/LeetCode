# 36. Valid Sudoku
## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)  
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

<small>A partially filled sudoku which is valid.</small>

**Example 1**:  

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
<b>Output:</b> true
</pre> 

**Example 2**:  
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
<b>Output:</b> false
<b>Explanation: </b> Same as Example 1, except with the <b>5</b> in the top left corner being 
    modified to <b>8</b>. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
</pre>

**Note:**  
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
- The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
- The given board size is always `9x9`.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        bool row[9][9] = {false};
        bool column[9][9] = {false};
        bool sub_boxes[9][9] = {false};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] != '.') {
                    int num = board[i][j] - '1';
                    int k = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3;
                    if (row[i][num] || column[j][num] || sub_boxes[k][num])
                        return false;
                    row[i][num] = true;
                    column[j][num] = true;
                    sub_boxes[k][num] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

*Analysis*:  
Yes there are two nested for loop, and we create three new 2D arrays. However, since they are all known fixed numbers and we can still treat the solution as a constant solution (with a big constant though:D).


**Idea**  
`row[0]` represents the appearances of nine numbers in the first row. Similarly, `col[0]` represents the appearances of nine numbers in the first column and `sub_boxes[0]` represents the appearances of nine numbers in the first sub-boxes (the top left block). The calculation of index of sub_boxes is a bit tricky and it uses integer division. In the loop, if the element is a digit, we need to check whether the row, column and sub-boxes has contained that digit or not. If so, it means that the sudoku is invalid and we should return false.
