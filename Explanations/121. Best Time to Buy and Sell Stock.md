# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## Problem
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)  
Say you have an array for which the *i*<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
**Example 1**:  

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
</pre> 

**Example 2**:  
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [7,6,4,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</pre>

## Solution
### Solution 1
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        
        int minPrice = prices[0], profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
                minPrice = prices[i];
            }
            else {
                profit = max(profit, prices[i] - minPrice);
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

*Analysis*:  
One loop which goes through the array once.

**Idea**  
The idea is when iterating through the array, we store the known minimum price (up to day *i*). If the price on day *i* is greater than minimum price, then calculate the profit and compare it to the maximum profit. If the price on day *i* is less than minimum price, then just update the minimum price.

### Solution 2
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        vector<int> differences;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            differences.push_back(prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        int profit = 0, current = 0;
        for (int diff : differences) {
            current = max(current + diff, diff);
            profit = max(profit, current);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

**Idea**  
This can be treated as a **Maximum subarray** problem.
