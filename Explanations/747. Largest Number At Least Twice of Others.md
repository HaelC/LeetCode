# Largest Number At Least Twice of Others
## Problem
In a given integer array `nums`, there is always exactly one largest element.  
Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.  
If it is, return the **index** of the largest element, otherwise return -1.  

**Example 1:**  

**Input**: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]  
**Output**: 1  
**Explanation**: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x, 6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.  

**Example 2:**  

**Input**: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
**Output**: -1  
**Explanation**: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.  

**Note**:  

1. `nums` will have a length in the range `[1,50]`.
2. Every `nums[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Solution
**Solution 1**:  
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dominantIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        int tempMax = -1, index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > tempMax) {
                tempMax = nums[i];
                index = i;
            }
        }
        
        for (auto &ele : nums) {
            if (ele * 2 > tempMax && ele != tempMax)
                return -1;
        }
        return index;
    }
};
```

**Solution 2**:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dominantIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1)
            return 0;
        
        int tempMax = 0, tempSecondMax = 0, index = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > tempMax) {
                tempSecondMax = tempMax;
                tempMax = nums[i];
                index = i;
            }
            else if (nums[i] > tempSecondMax) {
                tempSecondMax = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return (tempMax >= 2 * tempSecondMax) ? index : -1;
    }
};
```

## Idea
The first idea is to iterate the array for twice. The first time is to find the maximum element and the index. In the second iteration, check whether the largest number is more than twice as much as every other number in the array.  
The second idea reduce the number of iteration to only once: find the largest and second largest number simultaneously in one iteration. The finding is a bit more difficult than finding only the largest one. After that, compare the largest number and twice of the second largest. 
The time complexity of two ideas are the same (both linear).
